# Original Windows NT RS485 device driver source code
This driver was originally developed for Windows NT 3.51 and NT 4.0 and was ported Windows 2000 as a legacy (non-PnP) monolithic driver. The code in this repository is designed to be built by the WDK command line build environment. 

- Launch a WDK build environment (e.g., Windows x86 FREE build)
- Navigate to the appropriate folder (e.g., Code\SYS\)
- Build using `build -ceZ`
